Why Unit testing? Why we need to use all these frameworks for Unit testing when we already have an assert macro to use directly?

Unit testing is needed to check small parts and modules of your code individually and independently. So every time you write a function, you need to do its testing. So the naive way to write print() statements in your function to debug and test. Thats inefficent when working on large programs and complex data. So a better way is to use assert() statmenets in between, and whenever something unexpected is recieved, it throws an exception. But when we are "testing" code, we should be ideally testing exactly the same code we will be finally using for execution with the rest of our code. Thats why these assert() statements in between for each module's(each segment of code you are testing) testing is not the best way.
Hence, we use these unit testing frameworks such as for cpptest & gtest for cpp, and pytest for python, etc. These frameworks provide a way for you to easily include functions/modules from different files and use APIs/methods to do the testing. Hence the original code isn't modified, and our testing is also done!
